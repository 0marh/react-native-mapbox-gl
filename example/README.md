# React Native Mapbox GL Demo

Demo Application for [React Native Mapbox GL](../README.md)

## What is Mapbox?

Mapbox is the location data platform for mobile and web applications. We provide [building blocks](https://www.mapbox.com/products/) to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create. Use our simple and powerful APIs & SDKs and our open source libraries for interactivity and control.

## Sign up for Mapbox

Not a Mapbox user yet? [Sign up for an account here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/). Once youâ€™re signed in, all you need to start building is a Mapbox access token. Use this same short code with all of our interactive mapping libraries, Python and JavaScript SDKs, and directly against our REST APIs. You can [create and manage your access tokens in Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).

## Installation

* Create a file called `accesstoken` in the root of the example project and just paste in your [Mapbox access token](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/).

* Install our dependencies using `npm i`.
